"""Build SAP_Supply_Chain_Ontology_Project_Guide.docx.

The implementation-facing companion to the demo deck, following the section
structure of SAP_Finance_360_Project_Guide.docx so the two read as a set:
executive summary, project overview, architecture, data model, agent,
application stack, listing, installation, verification, support.

Where it deliberately diverges from the Finance guide: this project has two
halves that must not be conflated — an ONTOLOGY (15 classes, the model) and a
CATALOG (36 SAP BDC data products, metadata about what data exists). The guide
keeps them apart throughout, because a catalog cannot express that a Supplier and
a Customer are both Parties, which is the whole reason the ontology exists.

Figures are read from data/*.json in this repo, which is exported from the running
application, so the guide cannot drift from what the app reports.
