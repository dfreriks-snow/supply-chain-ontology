"""Build the presales kit documents for the SAP Partnership Compass page.

Three documents, written for the Snowflake presales team rather than for a
customer:

    00_START_HERE.docx        what is in the kit and which file to open when
    03_SE_Quick_Start.docx    positioning, a ten-minute path, objections
    06_Setup_and_Access.docx  live URL, local run, Snowflake objects

Figures come from data/ in this repo, which is exported from the running
application, so they cannot drift from what a demo actually shows.
