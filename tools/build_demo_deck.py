"""Build SAP_Supply_Chain_Ontology_Demo.pptx — the customer-facing demo deck.

Follows the shape of SAP_Finance_360_Demo.pptx so the two read as a set:
title, overview, challenge, solution, by-the-numbers, demo flow, a walkthrough
section with one slide per act, a technical architecture section, deployment
options, and a close. Seventeen slides on the shared Snowflake template, checked
by the shared deck verifier.

Figures come from data/*.json in this repo, exported from the running application,
so the deck cannot drift from what the app reports.
